# Project that implements end-to-end training, error analysis, and deployment to webcam (opencv) and mobile (CoreML)

Dataset is the SIGNS dataset developed by the CS230 class. The recognition challenge is to recognize the number of fingers showing of one hand in an image.

Main features include logging, training and modifying hyper-parameters using a json file, and logging performance and misclassification with Tensorflow. Code also includes how to run on threaded webcam using opencv and deploying to CoreML for iOS. 

This project was inspired by CS230 project repository and Andrew Ng's Structuring Machine Learning Project videos.
