# `tf.keras` Tutorial

tf.keras + tf.data with Eager Execution Tutorial notebooks shamelessly copied from [tensorflow/workshops](https://github.com/tensorflow/workshops)


## Requirements

You can use the latest version of TensorFlow which at this time is `1.9.0`, however the last notebook [7-estimators-multi-gpus.ipynb](7-estimators-multi-gpus.ipynb) will require `tf-nightly-gpu`.
